### AWS S3

When you're working with AWS S3 buckets you need to configure an appropriate CORS policy. The one provided below is useful for development because it allows all requests from anywhere but you will want to use something different in production.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
<CORSRule>
    <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
    <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedMethod>PUT</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedMethod>POST</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedMethod>DELETE</AllowedMethod>
    <MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
    <ExposeHeader>ETag</ExposeHeader>
    <AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
</CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```

The HTML file upload functionality uses an HTTPS API endpoint based on the bucket name (i.e. `https://<bucket>s3.amazonaws.com`). If the bucket name has dots (`.`) in the name this will fail because you can't use HTTPS with subdomains.

## Styling

The following HTML classes are made available alongside file types if you wish
to style them in your own application with a library like
[FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/):

* Folders: `s3c-folder-icon`
* Delete markers: `s3c-delete-icon`
* Version markers: `s3c-version-icon`
